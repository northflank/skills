# Northflank Plans & Regions

Generated from `GET https://api.northflank.com/v1/plans` and `GET https://api.northflank.com/v1/regions`. Both endpoints are public (no auth) — **query them directly if a SKU below looks stale or is missing**. Maintainers can refresh this file with `node scripts/generate_references.js --force`.

## Compute plans

Used as `billing.deploymentPlan` (and `billing.buildPlan` for plans flagged build-capable).

## GPU plans

GPU services use a paired plan slug: `nf-gpu-<gpuType>-<count>g`. Set `deployment.gpu` (or `billing.gpu`) with matching `gpuType` and `gpuCount`.

### GPU models (managed cloud)

Pricing is per GPU per hour, on top of the bundled CPU/RAM in the `nf-gpu-*` plan.

| Model | `gpuType` | VRAM | Counts per instance | $/hr per GPU | Available regions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA L4 | `l4-24` | 24 GB | 1, 2, 4, 8 | $0.80 | europe-west, us-central, asia-southeast, us-east1, us-west, asia-northeast, europe-west-frankfurt |
| NVIDIA A100 | `a100-40` | 40 GB | 1, 2, 4, 8 | $1.42 | us-central, europe-west-netherlands, asia-southeast, asia-northeast |
| NVIDIA A100 | `a100-80` | 80 GB | 1, 2, 4, 8 | $1.76 | us-central, europe-west-netherlands, asia-southeast, us-east1 |
| NVIDIA H100 | `h100-80` | 80 GB | 1, 2, 4, 8 | $2.74 | us-central, europe-west-netherlands, asia-southeast, us-east1, us-west, asia-northeast |
| NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 | `rtx_pro_6000-96` | 96 GB | 8 | $3.00 | europe-west, us-central, us-east-ohio |
| NVIDIA H200 | `h200-141` | 141 GB | 8 | $3.14 | us-central, europe-west-netherlands, us-east1, us-west |
